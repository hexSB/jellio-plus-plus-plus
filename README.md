# Jellio (Fork)

This is a fork of [Vanchaxy’s Jellio plugin](https://github.com/vanchaxy/jellio), which connects Jellyfin to Stremio so you can stream your Jellyfin library inside Stremio.
This fork is updated for **Jellyfin 10.11.2**.

All credit for the original work goes to Vanchaxy. This version includes small updates to keep the plugin working with the latest Jellyfin release.
